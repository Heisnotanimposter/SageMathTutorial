Sure! Let me explain the code in English.

1. Difficulty Level 1: Generating a 6x6 Matrix and a Diagonal Matrix

In the `matrix_generator.py` file, there are two functions:
- `generate_matrix()`: This function generates a 6x6 matrix `A` with elements of 0 and 1 arranged in a specific pattern.
- `generate_diagonal_matrix()`: This function generates a diagonal matrix `D` with diagonal elements [2, 3, 1].

2. Difficulty Level 2: Matrix Multiplication with Diagonal Matrix

In the `matrix_multiplier.py` file, there is one function:
- `matrix_multiplication_with_diagonal_matrix()`: This function calls the `generate_matrix()` and `generate_diagonal_matrix()` functions from the `matrix_generator.py` module to get the matrix `A` and diagonal matrix `D`. Then, it calculates the result of the matrix multiplication between `A` and `D` using the `dot` function from the numpy library.

3. Difficulty Level 3: Running the Program and Displaying the Result

In the `main.py` file, there is one function:
- `main()`: This function is the entry point of the program. It calls the `matrix_multiplication_with_diagonal_matrix()` function from the `matrix_multiplier.py` module to compute the result of the matrix multiplication. Then, it displays the result on the console.

When you run `main.py`, it will execute the whole process. The `matrix_generator.py` module generates the 6x6 matrix `A` and diagonal matrix `D`, while the `matrix_multiplier.py` module performs the matrix multiplication between `A` and `D`. Finally, the `main()` function in `main.py` displays the result of the multiplication on the console.

By modularizing the code, each step of the process is separated into different files, making the code more structured and manageable.
